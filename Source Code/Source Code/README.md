CZ4041 Project
Kaggle Competition - Sberbank Russian Housing Market
Done By: Group 27

1. The exploratory data analysis was done in the notebook "CZ4041_EDA_ipynb".
2. For the Random Forest model, "CZ4041_RF_Data_Cleaning.ipynb" has to be run first to generate a cleaned dataset to be used for the model.
3. Run the other notebooks in the corresponding folders to generate the submission CSV file. (Note: train.csv, test.csv, macro.csv files need to be in the same directory, with the exception of Random Forest model which generates an updated dataset from the cleaning notebook)
