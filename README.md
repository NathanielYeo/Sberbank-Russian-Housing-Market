# Sberbank-Russian-Housing-Market


## Problem Statement
Being a necessity and a tool of investment, the ability to understand housing prices can prove valuable for both home owners and prospective investors. A study that will enable both parties to understand the right time one should purchase or sell a house would prove to be useful and as such, Sberbank, a major bank in Russia took interest in this prospect and hosted a competition on kaggle that combines. The competition combines both Data Science and Machine Learning in hopes that a model based on observable factors would be created to allow for better understanding of how they affect housing prices.
